Data Analyst working in a Marketing analyst team at Cyclistic.(PS: this is hypothetically because it is for my Google Data Analytics Certificate)\nYou will find the full document for this case study [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone)\nI will following the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.**\n\n**Back Story - About Cyclistic**\nCyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.\n\nThe director of marketing, **Lily Moreno** believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.\n\n**Challenge:** Understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.\n**Goal:** design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. for this my team an I will need approval from The notoriously detail-oriented executive team\n\nAs earlier mentioned, I will be following the Data analysis Process to tackle this;\n\n# Ask\n**What is the question that will guide my team to solve this problem? **\n* What is the problem you are trying to solve? \nAccording to the director, Lily, Cyclistic's future success depends on an increase in annual membership, thus the problem here is maximizing annual membership.\n* How can your insights drive business decisions?\nThe insight will help my team come up with strategies to increase annual members\n\n**Business Task:** Find how casual riders use the bikes differently from members and how we can influence them to be annual members\n\n# Prepare\nFor this, data was provided by goggle in the course as it has been lisenced and made available by Motivate International Inc.You can find that [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). but since i will be using kaggle, I will go ahead to use the [Cyclistic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mihelic/cyclistic) provided by Kaggle which is a 12 months divvy-tripdata(from 202004 to 202103) the company provided.\n\n# Process\nLike I have earlier mentioned, I will be using R as a language in Kaggle. I will like to go ahead and assume the data has integrity because it is an internal data provided by the company, however, will check for inconsistencies in the columns and rows, outliers, clean the data and prepare for analysis. As we progress, will make markdown reports of steps taken. The dataset which is in different .csv files for each month will be merged to one dataframe for easy analysis\n\n**Will first load the libraries i will be using for my analysis and they are**\n*  Tidyverse which helps wrangle data\n*  Lubridate which helps wrangle data attributes\n*  ggplot2  which helps visualize

than casual riders\n* In each day there are also more member riders than casual riders except on saturday\n* The weekend had more ridership data than the rest of the week\n* The choice of ridable_bikes influence the number of rides \n* Members ride more on the weekdays \n* Casual riders have more ride duration than member riders \n\nMy team and business can apply this insight when preparing a marketing campaign the number of members by turning the casual riders\n\nFurther analysis could be done to improve my findings, like the routes taken by riders and how it infuences their
